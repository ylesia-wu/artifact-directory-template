Title:
SeeRise: Visualizing Emulated Sea Level Rise on Coastal Regions

Abstract:
The advent of sea level rise can have devastating consequences on coastal areas all around the world.  Low-lying regions—such as Florida, a state particularly susceptible to sea level rise due to its low-lying topography and extensive coastline—are especially a major focal point when it comes to modeling sea level rise as they are most vulnerable to changes. Using the method described by "A Semi-Empirical Approach to Projecting Future Sea-Level Rise", which regresses the rate of sea level rise on surface air temperature anomaly, our team coupled this model with emulators from the “ClimateBench v1.0: A Benchmark for Data-Driven Climate Projections” to create a predictor capable of simulating sea level rise in any future emission scenario, not just the ones prescribed by SSPs. This impact is then visualized using high-resolution topography data to assess the potential transformation of Florida’s coastal landscape, which can aid policymakers in developing mitigation and adaptation strategies.
